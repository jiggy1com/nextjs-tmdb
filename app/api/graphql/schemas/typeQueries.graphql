# resolverHandler: return type
# type Query {
#  <resolverHandlerName: returnType
# The return type is defined in the schemas
#}

# all combined typeQueries.graphql
type Query {
    hello: String
    greeting: [GreetingType]
    movie: Movie
    GreetingQuery: [GreetingObj]
    getMovieLatest: Movie
    #    getNowPlaying: GetNowPlayingResponse
}

# The alternative to the above approach is to have subsets of type Query in each schema file.
# The generated schema would then combine them all into one schema.
# extend type Query { <resolverHandlerName: returnType> }
# An example is in ./schemas/moviesNowPlaying.graphql
